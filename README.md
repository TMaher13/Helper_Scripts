# Helper Scripts

## Functions/configurations currently being built for:

  - Bash
  - C++
  - gdb

More will be added later, most likely for C and Python.

### Place the .bashrc, .vimrc, and .gdbinit files in your user directory (i.e. ~/.bashrc, ~/.vimrc, and ~/.gdbinit)
### Place the C++ file(s) wherever is convenient to include them in your project

If you have any useful functions/configurations, feel free to add onto what I have!
